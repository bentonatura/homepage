In a central step in the design of modern VLSI-chips, millions of pins have to be
connected. The scale of this task requires fast algorithms with provably good
performance.
The problem can be approximated by the Shallow-Light Steiner Arborescence
problem, in which we minimize the total length of a Steiner Arborescence that
propagates a signal from a source s to a set of sinks $T$, such that the delay on the
paths obeys given constraints. In our model, the delay depends on the length of the
path as well as on the number of edges on the path.
We present algorithms and inapproximability results for the general case and based
on this a quasilinear time algorithm with improved approximation guarantee for the
special case, where the metric space is $(\R^2, \ell^1)$.
