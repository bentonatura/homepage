Following the breakthrough work of Tardos (Oper. Res. '86) in the bit-complexity
model, Vavasis and Ye (Math. Prog. '96) gave the first exact algorithm for
linear programming in the real model of computation with running time depending
only on the constraint matrix. For solving a linear program (LP)
$\max\, c^\T x,\:  Ax = b,\:  x \geq 0,\:  A \in \R^{m \times n}$, Vavasis and Ye
developed a primal-dual interior point method using a \emph{`layered least
squares'} (LLS) step, and showed that $O(n^{3.5} \log
(\bar{\chi}_A+n))$ iterations suffice to solve (LP) exactly, where $\bar{\chi}_A$ is a condition measure
controlling the size of solutions to linear systems related to $A$. 

Monteiro and Tsuchiya (SIAM J. Optim. '03), noting that the central path is
invariant under rescalings of the columns of $A$ and $c$, asked whether there
exists an LP algorithm depending instead on the measure $\bar{\chi}^\ast_A$,
defined as the minimum $\bar{\chi}_{AD}$ value achievable by a column rescaling $AD$ of
$A$, and gave strong evidence that this should be the case. We resolve
this open question affirmatively. 

In this talk we will illustrate the central ideas of how to develop such an algorithm.
