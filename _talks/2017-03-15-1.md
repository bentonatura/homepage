A central step in the design of modern VLSI chips is routing. Hundreds of thousands of nets have to be routed under multiple constraints inculding timing, edge/placement congestion and blocked area. This complex task with subsequent buffering motivates various combinatorial problems. We present the Global Routing problem and its solution in a Resource Sharing Framework using a sophisticated Steiner Tree Embedding as its routing oracle. Furthermore, we present a fast Buffering routine, that proves to be useful in early stages of the presented algorithm for Resource Sharing.
