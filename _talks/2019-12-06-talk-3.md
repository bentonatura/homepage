We present an algorithm for solving feasibility of real-number
linear programs in standard form $Ax = b, x \ge 0$ where $A \in \R^{m \times n}, x \in \R^n, b \in R^m$. In particular, we present a recursive
algorithm using primal-dual interior-point methods that solves
feasibility within $O(n^{1.5} \log\bar\chi_A)$ iterations, where $\bar\chi_A$ is a condition measure of $A$ that was introduced by Dikin. This is a significant improvement over the best previous result by Ye,
who developed a two-layered interior-point method that runs for
$O(n^{2.5} \log \bar\chi_A)$ iterations. It is widely assumed that feasibility
can not be solved significantly faster than optimization. Thus,
we suggest that the current best interior-point method based algorithm that runs in $O(n^{3.5} \log \bar\chi_A)$ iterations can be improved.
We outline how to approach optimality with the techniques developed for feasibility.
This is joint work with Daniel Dadush and L&aacute;szl&oacute; A. V&eacute;gh.
