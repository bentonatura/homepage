I am a second year PhD student at the [London School of Economics](http://lse.ac.uk) under supervision of [L&aacute;szl&oacute;
V&eacute;gh](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/){:target="_blank"}. I am funded by his [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/) grant [ScaleOpt](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/scaleopt.html){:target="_blank"}. 
Both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees were received from The University of Bonn under supervision of [Stephan Held](http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~held/Stephan_Held.html){:target="_blank"} and [Jens Vygen](http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~vygen/){:target="_blank"}. 
My research interests are in Operational Research, Combinatorial Optimization, Convex Optimization and Game Theory.
